# Sentinel Extreme Pro
Keep on asking for input (``int``) until a zero is entered or when 10 numbers have been entered.
Finally, print *the index* of both the smallest and the largest number that was entered (zero does not count).
The index of the first number is 1, the index of the second is 2, ...

If no numbers were entered (only zero), you should print two zeros.
